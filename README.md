## Example

A simple example where we log in, search for `"album:belle"`, dump the results to stdout and finally log out:

    var session = new Session({applicationKey: myAppkey});
    session.login("username", "password", function (err) {
      if (err) return sys.error(err.stack || err);
      session.search('album:belle', function(err, result){
        sys.puts(sys.inspect(result));
        session.logout();
      })
    });
